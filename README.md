# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
Predicting retail sales dynamics using features like store type, size, and holidays. This analysis combines multiple datasets to explore key variables that influence sales, aiming to guide inventory management and marketing strategies.
# Introduction:
This project aims to predict sales for Walmart stores by considering multiple factors like store type, size, holidays, and other external variables. By merging and analyzing various datasets, the project offers insights to maintain inventory levels, optimize marketing strategies, and drive sales.

# Data Loading & Initial Exploration:
The project starts by loading four distinct datasets: 'features', 'stores', 'train', and 'test'. These datasets collectively offer information on external variables like temperature, fuel price, and markdown details, as well as internal store data such as type, size, and weekly sales across different departments.

# Data Cleaning & Transformation:
The data cleaning phase involved handling missing values and standardizing date formats. For instance, missing values in the markdown columns were replaced with zero, and linear interpolation was applied to the 'CPI' and 'Unemployment' columns.

# Feature Engineering:
Date columns were dissected to extract 'Year' and 'Month' for easier time-based analysis. Store types were one-hot encoded to prepare the dataset for predictive modeling.

# Objectives:
Merge and clean various datasets for a comprehensive analysis
Conduct a month-wise and year-wise sales analysis
Utilize machine learning techniques to predict future sales

# Business Impact:
Understanding and predicting sales dynamics helps Walmart optimize its operations, improve its marketing strategies, and better manage inventory, thus directly influencing profitability and customer satisfaction.

# Future Work:
Incorporate more external factors like holidays and events to refine predictive models.
Apply advanced machine learning techniques for better predictive accuracy.
